Login
=====

A simple yeoman based project to design a login page for a larger web framework.

The design is pretty much a clone of this
http://dribbble.com/shots/917819-iPad-Calendar-Login, which I saw
in an article from http://designmodo.com/flat-design-principles/
and liked so much I wanted to use it for my login page.

I'm intending to add a little bit of JavaScript to handle form
submission and possibly error handling too. Yeoman was used so I
could work on the SASS for CSS. Using the live reloader is a better
workflow because you get instant feedback.

Right now it looks like this
